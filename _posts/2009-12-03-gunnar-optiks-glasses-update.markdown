All I can say is I love my [Gunnar Optiks](http://www.gunnars.com) Rx computer glasses.  My whole body just feels better at the end of the day and I have a lot less sensitivity to light at 10pm.  In general, during my day, I concentrate more and lose myself in my work more since I got these glasses.  I highly recommend them to everyone who spends most of their day in front of a computer monitor.
