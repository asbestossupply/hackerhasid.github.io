I just fixed a bug that looks like it’s been on my blog for the last 6 months or so that prevented people from posting comments.  I was unaware of the issue (though I did find it curious that I’ve had so few comments on my later posts) until recently.  Thanks to Travis Illig for some pointers ([http://www.paraesthesia.com/archive/2010/11/03/the-subtext-2-5-2-0-email-debacle-solved.aspx](http://www.paraesthesia.com/archive/2010/11/03/the-subtext-2-5-2-0-email-debacle-solved.aspx)).
  
Feel free to comment on posts and if you have any issues, you can always contact me on twitter (@statichippo) or via email noah at statichippo dot com.
