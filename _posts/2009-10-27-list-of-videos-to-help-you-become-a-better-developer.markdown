I'm constantly watching videos (many times while I work) and figured I'd compile a list of the ones I find most helpful.&nbsp; Hard part is I've watched so many good ones in the past that I don't know how I'll think of them all!&nbsp; But from here on in I'll try to post them into this collection.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">General Development</span><br />
MIT OpenCourseWare has a full video course entitled[ Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](javascript:void(0);/*1256652499881*/).&nbsp; These lectures are pretty fundamental but I found them intriguing nonetheless.&nbsp; Discussions include  Big O notation, dynamic programming, binary search, random walks,&nbsp; and some other goodies.&nbsp; Must watch for anyone who does not have a CompSci degree.
