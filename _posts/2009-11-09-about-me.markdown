My name is Noah Blumenthal.&nbsp; I'm a software developer with almost a decade of experience coding in different languages on different platforms.&nbsp; I'm currently consulting and living in NYC.&nbsp; I love what I do and am really passionate about software development.&nbsp; One great thing about this industry is that there's really no end to self improvement -- no matter how much you know there's always more to learn.<br />
<br />
I got my first job when I was only 12 years old (actually it was an unpaid internship -- the company couldn't legally pay me because I was too young).&nbsp; I had taught myself HTML and was pretty good with hardware (I had already blown out probably a dozen motherboards in overclocking accidents), and my jobs varied accordingly.&nbsp; At one point the boss urged me to learn "classic" ASP and I took the Wrox book home and learned it pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
A few years later, after working in a number of different roles, I decided that software development was what I wanted to do with my life.&nbsp; I took a couple JAVA course and got certified as a Sun JAVA Certified Programmer.&nbsp; I started college at 16, but The dot-com boom was in full swing and I left school to work full time developing software.&nbsp; I really believed that I would be a millionaire before I was 20.<br />
<br />
I started working with Microsoft technologies around the time they released .NET 2.0.&nbsp; Interestingly enough I had attended a Microsoft event when they first came out with .NET 1 and I won a book on .NET from Microsoft Press in their giveaway after the event.&nbsp; It stayed on my bookshelf for a year or so, but in retrospect I guess it was some sort of sign.&nbsp; Now I work almost exclusively with Microsoft technologies, but my years with Linux, PHP and JAVA come in handy pretty often.
