The next language I’ll be learning will be F#.  I just started and have already written my first stack overflow!  But it taught me a lesson about the order of precedents in F#.
  
I was writing my first real function, one that wasn’t pre-written in the tutorials I was using (at least not that I got up to yet!): Fibonacci.  I started with

{% highlight fsharp %}
let rec fib x =
  if x = 0 then
    0
  elif x = 1 then
    1
  else
    (fib x-1)+(fib x-2)

printfn "fib 10 is %A" (fib 10)
{% endhighlight %}


and that crashed the interpreter!  can you spot the problem?


line 7 does this:

* compute fib x
* subtract 1 from that
* compute fib x
* subtract 2 from that
* add the two together

I should have written

{% highlight fsharp %}
fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)
{% endhighlight %}

I’m learning here!


The next step, using match patterns instead of if’s.  And Matthew Podwysocki’s got a great write up of that over [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/03/17/adventures-in-f-f-101-part-5-pattern-matching.aspx)!  Too bad he solved my Fibonacci problem.  Now I’ll have to come up with another problem to really learn the language.  Any suggestions?
