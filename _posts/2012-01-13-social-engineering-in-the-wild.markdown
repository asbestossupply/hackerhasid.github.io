My friend just called me to tell me something that happened to him.  He received a phone call from an unknown number.  There was a man on the other line who claimed to be from the internet provider or something of the sort and told my friend that he noticed that my friend’s router and therefore computers had been infected with a virus.  My friend was told to go to one of his internet-connected computers and the caller would step him through the necessary process to rid himself of this virus.  Luckily my friend realized this seemed fishy (or phishy I suppose) and started asking the caller some questions, received no good answers, and decided to hang up.
  
Beware!
