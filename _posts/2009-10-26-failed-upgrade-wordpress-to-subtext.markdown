  ## Well, that didn&rsquo;t work!
  
 
  
I thought it would be pretty easy to convert to Subtext from Wordpress (even though it’s a bit of a hack) as I mentioned [in this blog post](http://blog.statichippo.com/archive/2009/10/24/new-blog.aspx).  However, I was very mistaken.  I was able to export from SubText to BlogML (after installing Wordpress on my local machine etc) but the outputted BlogML file caused an error while importing to SubText.
  
After spending a couple hours on it I decided I would be better off just taking the important posts from Wordpress, downloading them into Windows Live Writer, and uploading them to SubText.
  
That, too, had it’s share of difficulties.  First there were the missing posts, then the posts and now I have posts that show up on [blog.statichippo.com](http://blog.statichippo.com) and in Windows Live Writer but not in the SubText admin.
  
Anyway I’m probably just going to leave it as is.  The important posts (the one’s people actually read) are here even if the comments are not and it’s not like I had anything that earth shattering on WordPress anyway.
