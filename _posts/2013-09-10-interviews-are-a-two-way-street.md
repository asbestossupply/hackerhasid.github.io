title: Interviews are a Two Way Street
---
After the May 1st acquisition of GroupCommerce I was looking for my next adventure. I started with GroupCommerce early on, while we were still taking up a single table in an incubator space, and loved the aura of adventure and excitement; I knew I wanted to do something early stage again. So I spent the following couple months meeting with entrepreneurs over coffee (way, way too much coffee!). I recently took a position as Director of Engineering for [InterviewJet](http://www.interviewjet.com) (and so far I'm loving it) but that's not what this post is about. A couple weeks ago I quit a job I had taken only a little over a month beforehand; this post is about some lessons I learned from that experience...

TLDR: [Some Lessons I Learned](#lessons)

##### The Backdrop

Soon after GroupCommerce closed its doors a buddy referred me to a recruiter friend of his who works with startups. Partly to do him a favor and (obviously?) partly for myself I met with this recruiter. As you can imagine the stages of startups he works with is not exactly what I was looking for but I figured it was worth a shot.

So I had been meeting with entrepreneurs for a while and had some very interesting offers and soon-to-be offers from varying stages of early stage startups. There were two or three that I was very interested in and I figured one of those would probably work out and a decision would be made for me. Then this recruiter called about a company that he thought would be a good fit. Turns out the company provides a single-page javascript app and is using some interesting tech behind the scenes too. They're well funded since the CEO is quite wealthy but after a few years of floundering and a massive rewrite they're desperate for someone to come on and own the client-side. The way the CEO put it is he was looking to finish the tripod on which the business stands - there was already product and backend, he needed someone to own the frontend. As a single-page app, 'frontend' takes on a litte different meaning than on a standard website so though I'm not really a 'frontend' guy, owning the frontend in this case seemed appealing. The startup was already a few years old - not exactly what I had been looking for - but they were still a very small shop and they had just rewritten everything from scratch so in some ways they were brand new. Besides, helping them turn around after struggling for so long would be an incredible experience for me.

##### The Interview

The office was located in the back of the CEO's other business in a building full of marble, mohogany, hedge funds and people wearing suits; I showed up in jeans and a t-shirt. I sat down with the CTO at a large, shiny table and we discussed some functional programming concepts and how the codebase had been written using different functional concepts. There was little whiteboarding and no real problem solving. Then I met the CEO and we chatted for a bit just about life and such. Then the CEO came back with an offer on the spot - not exactly traditional. It took some convincing - I was working on a project I really liked and though it didn't really pay I knew I wanted to work on it. But in the end I decided to take the position.

##### The First Days

I had a vacation scheduled months before but since I just took a job I pushed the vacation off by a couple days, showed up on a Monday and then left that evening, and worked remotely almost full time - so much for a vacation! From the get-go there were quite a few late nights; they were really playing catch-up with this rewrite. The code took some getting used to - the frontend is a fairly complex single page app built without the aid of frameworks. My initial tasks were basically grunt work, pretty typical for helping an employee get up to speed with the codebase. The more I investigated the codebase though, the more I found things that troubled me. One issue was the uniqueness of it all - the decision not to use existing frameworks and to write very non javascript-like javascript seemed faulty to me; onboarding new employees (like me) required a significant time investment and you can forget getting short-term consulting help to with these late nighters. The CTO however clearly had very strong feelings about how code should be written and the usefulness of other peoples' code.  My vacation lasted a month. By two or three weeks in I was frustrated; I didn't like the codebase I was working on, I didn't like the work I was doing, and I didn't feel like my thoughts were being heard. But I _was_ working remotely, perhaps that was the issue.

##### The Resignation

I lasted maybe 2 weeks after returning from vacation before resigning. I approached the CTO a week beforehand and tried to explain the issues I was having but didn't feel that I was particularly heard. I slept on the decision for a few more days and then emailed the CTO and CEO saying I wanted to meet with them. I think they knew what was coming. But it was actually a few days before I could get the CTO and CEO in a room together. First the CTO had pulled an all-night coding session and didn't come in, then it poured and I figured why come in through the pouring rain, quit, then go straight home? So a few days after I decided to quit I got the CEO and CTO in a room together and told them I didn't think the job was right for me. The CEO said "OK" and asked if today would be my last day. I came in willing to work with them through a transition so I replied something like "sure, if that works for you" and went back to my desk. I started writing a postmortem when the CEO came by and told me there was no need for me to stay the rest of the day - a polite way of asking me to leave *now*. So I packed up my stuff, said goodbye to everyone, explained that I'm sorry it didn't work out, rode down the elevators with a bunch of men in suits, and left the building heading home feeling very light and airy.

##### The Aftermath

I ended up sending a retrospective to the CEO, CTO and head of product. As I said in the email, they don't really know me and things didn't work out, so they can take my advice with a grain of salt, but if the roles were reversed I would want to hear their thoughts and so maybe they feel the same way. I also had a recruiter reach out - this was before I took them off my LinkedIn profile - saying he noticed a new job post at my company and would I be interested in working with him to find someone - that was kind of funny.

I quit on the 14th of the month, payroll ran on the 15th and I got a direct deposit. A couple days later the direct deposit was undeposited. I didn't know you could do that. I could understand undepositing part of the paycheck (only right actually - like I said, I quit on the 14th) but the whole thing? Not worth making a big deal about but not a very nice thing to do in my opinion (and possibly illegal?).

##### <a id="lessons"></a>The Lessons

* The CEO and CTO don't always agree on why you're needed. Make sure to hear from everyone you can what they expect your role and responsibilities to be
* It's super important to interview the company you'll be working for. Speaking to the CTO and CEO is not enough (unless that's the whole company); you really need to speak to other employees to get a sense of the culture (and past employees too if possible)
* Ask questions about views on technology. Some people are very opinionated about what is *right* and *wrong*, *good* and *bad* in computer science
* Sometimes startups can have *too much* money. Limited resources necessitate innovation and collaboration

And if all else fails:

* Once you know you're not happy, it's time to go!
