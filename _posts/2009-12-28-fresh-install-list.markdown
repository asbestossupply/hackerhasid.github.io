My laptop has not been behaving lately and I figured it’s time for a wipe & a fresh install.  I was compiling a list of all the apps I need to install and figured I’d share it with the world.  My current feeling is that anything not on this list will have to be installed on a VM, but we’ll see how long that lasts.  I really just want my new install to be clean and tidy.
  
 
  ### Development
  
Visual Studio 2008
  
Expression Studio 3
  
SQL Server 2008
  
CodeRush & Refactor! Pro – you’d have to be a masochist not to use some sort of code assistance plugin
  
TortoiseSVN
  
VisualSVN – integrates SVN (runs on top of TortoiseSVN) straight into Visual Studio.  $49 and worth every penny!
  
WinMerge – it’s free and so much better than WinDiff
  
Fiddler2 – a terrific web debugging proxy.  It’s free and worth every penny (and then some)
  ### Communication
  
Pidgin – my officemates use AIM (and probably Win95 too), but I use GTalk for everything else.  1 (free) app is better than 2
  
uTorrent – I was an Azureus guy until they turned into Vuze and increased their bloat exponentially.  uTorrent does the job, and does it well.
  
Windows Live Writer – it’s actually a great blogging software.  Seriously!    - CodeSnippet plugin
  
TweetDeck – my twitter client of choice
  ### Tools
  
Notepad++ – because notepad sucks
  
VirtualBox – really great Virtualization software, and it’s free
  
Paint.NET – comes in handy way more than I thought
  
PeaZip – open source, handles tons of file formats, and it’s prettier than 7zip
  
Virtual CloneDrive – freeware tool to mount ISO and other images.  Don’t ask me why Windows doesn’t come with this!
  ### Firefox Plugins
  
Firebug
  
YSlow
  
Adblock Plus
  
Windows Media Player Plugin
