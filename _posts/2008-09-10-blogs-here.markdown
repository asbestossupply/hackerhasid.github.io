So I've finally been motivated to put up a blog. I've been stalling for a long time. I constantly would ask myself, "how often am I really going to post?" In the past my answer to that question was typically "never", but recently I've been motivated quite frequently. So here we go... We'll see if I can keep it up ;).

The purpose of this blog is to post rants, raves, tips, and reminders to myself that come up in my day to day life as a .NET developer. I hope some of my future posts will help other developers.
