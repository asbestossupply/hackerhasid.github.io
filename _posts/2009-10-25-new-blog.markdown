I got tired of my Wordpress.com hosted version of Wordpress and moved over to SubText on my own host.&nbsp; I'm transferring the important posts here.&nbsp; This should give me some more control...<br />
<br />
Turns out it's not so easy to transfer between Wordpress and SubText.&nbsp; Wordpress provides export functionality to a Wordpress compatible format (called WXR).&nbsp; SubText on the other hand accepts BlogML format for the imports.<br />
<br />
Luckily, someone took most of the legwork out of the conversion already.&nbsp; There's a Wordpress BlogML export utility over on [codeplex](javascript:void(0);/*1256433871452*/) that replaces the built in export utility of Wordpress so that instead of outputting WXR it outputs BlogML.<br />
<br />
Since my blog was hosted over at Wordpress.com I don't have much control over this, so I'm going to have to <br />
<br />
1) install Wordpress myself (with this BlogML export hack), <br />
2) import my posts from the hosted edition, <br />
3) export the posts so that they are now in BlogML format, <br />
4) and then import to SubText.<br />
<br />
Wish me luck!
