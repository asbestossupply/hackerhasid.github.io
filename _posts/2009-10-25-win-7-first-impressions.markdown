One word: **nice!**
  
The install was easy and everything worked right out of the box – even my Dell Wireless 802.11n card which Vista had numerous problems with.  My Dell Webcam software was actually installed too, which is pretty nice.
  
All in all, I’m happy.  The interface is very clean and much more productive than any other version of Windows.
  
The taskbar has all your open windows.  The image above is the icon for Windows Explorer.  Notice the green on the left hand side?  That’s actually a progress bar – I was copying a large directory when I took this snapshot.  The green bar moved all the way over to the right to let me know it was done – no need to check the actual window.  That was really nice.
