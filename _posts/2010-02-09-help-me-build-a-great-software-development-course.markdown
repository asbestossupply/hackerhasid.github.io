It looks like I might be giving a course on Beginning .NET Development to non developers with IT backgrounds.  I'm putting together my lectures and it's really hard.  I want to make sure that I explain things so others can understand them.  
  
Even though this is a .NET course (with a web-based slant), I really see it as a fundamental software development (crash) course.  You can’t become a great developer without understanding what’s going on behind the scenes.  If you have any thoughts or advice on any of the topics at hand (am I missing a topic?  are they poorly ordered?  do you have a great analogy for something?) or just some general thoughts or advice, I'd be grateful if you would pass them along.

#### Here's what I have in regards to topics for the course:
  
Principals in software engineering
* What are numbers (decimal, binary, hex)
* Memory & microprocessors (rundown on how code gets executed)
   
Into to OOP
* What's assembly language
* C and low level languages
* Beginning OOP (concepts relevant to OOP)
   
Microsoft .NET Platform
* Native executable vs intermediate language (history, how it works)
* Basic types & operators
* Pass by Value vs reference
* Using Visual Studio
   
Principals of web architecture
* What's the internet?
* State vs stateless
   
Fundamentals of ASP.NET
* What is ViewState?
* Configuration
   
Proficiency in C#
* Basic structure
* Flow control, ifs, fors, whiles, methods
* OOP (classes, interfaces, polymorphism)
* Generics
* Lambda expressions & functional programming
   
Those last 2 topics might have to be left for the next, more advanced course depending on time contraints
